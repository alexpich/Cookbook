# Cookbook

This project is actively being worked on!

The goal of this mobile app is to help users learn how to cook any type of meal. As a person learning to cook, I constantly wondered if there were an easier way to dice my onions or to quickly chop scallions. With this app, we can thorougly explain each step of the cooking process as well as demonstrating little video clips on how to do each step as to prevent any confusion!
